# 3D U-Net Model

Team contributor: EJZ



## Summary


## Introduction
Unet model performs quite well on image segmentation. dMRI metrics is more similar between diffusion dataset and the volume values.
In this mini-project, we are trying to use unet to do image segmentation.

*Goal* 

1. unet model;
2. apply it on hj dMRI metrics and other accessible data;
3.

*Acknowledgement*

This is an interesting mini-project and will be released by the late of December 2022.
